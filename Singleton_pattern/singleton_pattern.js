// When to Use the Singleton Pattern:
// Configuration Management: When you need a central point to manage configuration settings across your application.
// Logging: When a single instance of a logging class is required to write logs consistently across different parts of the application.
// Connection Pools: When managing a pool of database connections, ensuring only one pool exists at any given time.
// Resource Sharing: When certain resources (like a file handle or network connection) should be shared across the application.
// 1. Global State
// Challenge: Singletons maintain global state, which can make it 
//             difficult to track down where and how state changes are happening across an application.
// Impact: Bugs can arise from unintended side effects when the global state is modified 
//         in one part of the application and unexpectedly impacts another part.
// Example: If a Singleton class maintains configuration settings, changing a setting in 
//         one test might affect other tests that are not expecting that configuration.
// Considerations:
// Global State: Singleton pattern introduces global state into your application, which can sometimes lead to 
//                challenges in testing and debugging.
// Thread Safety: In multi-threaded environments, you need to ensure that the Singleton 
//                 implementation is thread-safe, which may require additional mechanisms like locks or 
//                 using async methods for instance creation.
